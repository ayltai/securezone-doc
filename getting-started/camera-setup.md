# Camera Setup

Cameras that support RTSP or HTTP/S streaming are compatible with SecureZone. If your camera support multiple sstreams, it is recommended to use a substream with a resolution of 1080p or lower. A 640x360 or 640x480 resolution is recommended for the best performance.

If your camera supports multiple frame rates, it is recommended to use a lower frame rate, such as 15fps.

SecureZone also supports cameras that are added to Synology Surveillance Station. If you have a camera that is not supported by SecureZone, you can add it to Surveillance Station and then add it to SecureZone.
