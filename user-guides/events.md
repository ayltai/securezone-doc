# Events

Events are a collection of triggered intrusion detections. You can review the events that have been triggered by clicking on the Events tab in the sidebar. The Events tab will display a list of all the events that have been triggered, along with the date and time that the event was triggered. You can click on the snapshot of the event to view what triggered the event and where it occurred and the detection confidence level. If you are subscribed to the Standard or Premier plan, you can also view the event video showing what exactly happened during the event.

## Filtering Events

You can filter events by the following criteria:

* **Date Range**: Filter events by a specific date range.
* **Monitor name**: Filter events by a specific monitor.
* **Deleted objects**: Filter events by deleted objects.

## Deleting Events

To delete an event, click on the **Delete** button of the event you want to delete. To delete multiple events, click on the checkbox of the events you want to delete and then click on the **Delete** button at the top of the list.
