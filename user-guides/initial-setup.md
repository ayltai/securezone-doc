# Initial setup

Because SecureZone requires a paid subscription to use, you will need to create an account and subscribe to a plan before you can start a monitor for intrusion detection. This guide will walk you through the initial setup process.

## Create an account

1. Go to the SecureZone web UI. Depending on the installation method, it may be at `http://localhost:8002/web`.
2. Choose any of the available sign-up methods.
3. Fill in the required information and click **Sign Up**.

Once you have created an account, you will be taken to the monitor list.

## Subscribe to a plan

1. Click **My Account** menu item in the left sidebar.
2. Click **Upgrade**.
3. Choose a plan that suits your needs.
4. Fill in the required information and click **Subscribe**.

Once you have subscribed to a plan, you will be taken back to the **My Account** page. It may take a few minutes for the changes to take effect. You can refresh the page to see the updated plan information.

## Next steps

Now that you have created an account and subscribed to a plan, you can start setting up a monitor for intrusion detection. Refer to the [Monitor setup guide](monitors.md) for more information.
